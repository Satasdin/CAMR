# Decisions

Technical calls made while building engram, each with its reason. Ibrahim's own calls (the name, the look, fade
never destroy, the headline, scripted lives only) are in the plan: https://claude.ai/artifact/9ZeFGovgtQHjGfKw7CJ8AN

## Step 0: the ruler (2 November 2026)

**E-01 Home.** `~/Developer/engram`, outside iCloud: iCloud evicted files from the old project's virtual environment
and stalled imports. The old CAMR (`~/Desktop/camr-repo`) is the baseline and is not changed by engram.

**E-02 One reader and one embedder for every contender.** Qwen3-1.7B-4bit reads; Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-4bit reads for
the "camr-4b" contender only. Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-4bit-DWQ embeds. All run with MLX. Only the memory differs between
contenders, so the comparison is between memories, not models. The old CAMR's Ollama models are gone, so its engine
runs unchanged as a library (installed with `--no-deps -e`) with these models plugged in.

**E-03 The old CAMR as it shipped.** Its engine is configured exactly as CAMR Personal configured it
(`camr/app/assistant.py`):
- similarity ranking with a gate and entity bridging;
- notes found by keywords added to the vector hits;
- dates, time periods, profile notes, counting and the slot gate on;
- whole notes, and the app's 512-token context.

The record stores the camr commit and whether its engine files had local changes.

**E-04 Its similarity threshold, re-chosen for the new embedder.** The app's 0.50 belonged to its old embedder. The
threshold was chosen on the development lives (seed 0) by retrieval alone: does the packed context name the right
answer, and does the engine decline when nothing was told? 0.55 to 0.75 tie at 229 of 300 and 0.80 falls to 196.
The middle of that plateau, **0.65**, is used. See `records/calibration/camr-min-similarity.json`. Seed-1 lives were
never used.

**E-05 Lives.** There are three personas: a student, a dairy-cooperative manager and a developer. Seed 1 is for the
proof; seed 0 is for development and calibration. A life is fully fixed by its persona and seed. Each has 84 days,
about 330 messy notes and 100 questions:
- 45 single facts;
- 15 that change;
- 10 told across two notes;
- 15 dates;
- 15 never told.

**E-06 Time words are never misspelt.** A typo inside "yesterday" made the right date ambiguous even to a person, so
"today", "yesterday" and "morning" are exempt from the typo step.

**E-07 Grading is rule-based, not an LLM judge.** The same answer always gets the same verdict, a run costs nothing
extra, and anyone can re-grade. Verdicts are `right`, `stale` (names a value an update replaced), `missed` (declines a
told fact), `wrong`, `right_abstain` and `false_memory` (answers something never told).

**E-08 The growth metric** is facts answered right out of the 100, drawn against "told so far". Honesty is reported
separately, as false memories, so a contender cannot score by declining.

**E-09 The quiz** runs at the end of each week after that night's sleep: the same 100 questions every week, graded
against that day's right answers.

**E-10 Deterministic answers.** Decoding is greedy, Qwen3's thinking is off, and answers are capped at 40 new tokens.

**E-11 The wait** runs from question asked to first word. It includes retrieval for the old CAMR. For the perfect
reader it includes reading every note once, because a single question would have to. Within a quiz the perfect reader
keeps those notes as a cache and rewinds after each question, so a run takes minutes rather than hours.

**E-12 Provenance before the first commit.** Every record carries `engram_source_sha`, a hash of `engram/**/*.py`, so
it names the code that produced it.

**E-13 The baseline runs.** All twelve records (three lives × four contenders) came from code `a6beaea852f10d1a`.
That is the code in the first commit. The ending of a Claude session killed the first attempt in week 4 of the
student life's old-CAMR run. That partial record was set aside, not kept. `scripts/baselines.sh` was made resumable
and restarted, detached and with the Mac kept awake. The student life's first three runs were on battery and the
rest on the charger. On battery the old CAMR waited 1.31 s; on the charger, in the other two lives, it waited 1.31 s
and 1.28 s. The bare model waited 0.20 s, against 0.18 s and 0.19 s.
